       "   'body': 'Both are indeed bullish, and stocks are up because lack of volatility- it’s incredibly likely dems take the White House, and pretty likely they get at least 50 senate seats. Stimulus and a consistent government is also bullish. However, if you see a tax hike passed it will certainly result in the market going down somewhat. Rich people put most of their money in the market, institutional investors using their money are 80% of the market - and a tax hike will inevitably scare some of their money out. The hedge funds will alter their algorithms based on the new taxes. Not to mention stock buybacks will decrease - they were easy to do thanks to corporations having a ton more in profits. Stock buybacks were a huge reason why the market rose so much under trump. Point is lack of volatility is good, but a little lower liquidity will still cause stocks to fall (though you’re probably safe here, doubt taxes would go up until at least 2022 probably 2023 to make sure we recover from COVID first)',\n",

It's not unreasonable to say 'they expect him to die'. Especially since he's having a severe case - which from what I know at least - seems to be the primary indicator of having a higher chance of passing. That's all the person was saying, and everyone responding is pulling out stats like they're some sort of specialist.\\n\\nDude has a severe case with comorbidities. How significantly different can his course of treatment really be?\",\n",
